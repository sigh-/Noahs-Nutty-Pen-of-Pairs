11 Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. <br/>
12 God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. <br/>
13 So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.
 I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. <br/>
 14 So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.<br/>
 15 This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.<br/>
 16 Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, 
 middle and upper decks. <br/>
 17 I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. 
 Everything on earth will perish. <br/>
 18 But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark-you and your sons and your wife 
 and your sons' wives with you.<br/>
 19 You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.<br/>
 20 Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.<br/>
 21 You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them."<br/>

22 Noah did everything just as God commanded him.

1 The Lord then said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation."<br/>

13 On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.<br/>
14 They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along
the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings. <br/>
15 Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark. <br/> 16 The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. 
 Then the Lord shut him in.<br/>

17 For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. <br/>
18 The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.<br/>
 19 They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.<br/>
 20 The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.
 21 Every living thing that moved on land perishedâ€”birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.<br/>
 22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.<br/>
 23 Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the 
 ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.<br/>

24 The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.

1 But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, 
and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded. <br/>
2 Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.<br/> 
3 The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, <br/>
4 and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. <br/>
5 The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.
<br/><br/>
....<br/><br/>
12 And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: <br/>
13 I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.<br/>
14 Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,<br/>
15 I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. <br/>
16 Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."
